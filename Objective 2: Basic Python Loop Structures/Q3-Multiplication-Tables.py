Question 3: Nested Loops (Multiplication Table)
Description: Write a program that uses nested loops to print the multiplication table for numbers 1 to 5.
'''

# This program will print the multiplication tables from 1 to 5 

# Use a for loop to iterate through the numbers for each table
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"table for {i}: {i * 1, i * 2, i * 3, i * 4, i * 5}")


    # Use a nested loop to print the table for each number
