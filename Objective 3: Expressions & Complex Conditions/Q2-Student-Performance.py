# This program checks if a student passes based on grade and attendance

grade = float(input("Enter your grade: "))
attendance = float(input("Enter your attendance percentage: "))

# Use complex conditions to determine if the student passed
if grade >= 65 and attendance >= 75:
    print("You Pass!")
